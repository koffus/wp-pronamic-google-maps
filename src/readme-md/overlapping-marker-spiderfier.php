## Overlapping Marker Spiderfier

The Pronamic Google Maps plugin has built-in support for the [Overlapping Marker Spiderfier](https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier) library.
This library will be enabled if you pass in the `overlapping_marker_spiderfier_options` argument in the mashup arguments, see example below.

### Example

```php
<?php readfile( __DIR__ . '/example-overlapping-marker-spiderfier.php' ); ?>
```
